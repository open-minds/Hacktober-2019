This calculator is my first attemtp at WPF, it can perform simple mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication...etc. In order to add a little "something" to it, the calculator offers a small fun fact about the calculated result (only if it's an integer).

## Tools used:
* Visual studio (IDE)
* C# (logic)

## TODO:

- [x] Make the API call asynchronous.
